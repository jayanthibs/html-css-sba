What accessibility challenges did you face, and how did you address them?

It was challenging to implement ARIA attributes and following all the guidelines for accessibility. So I did some research on all the accessibility features and implemented them in my project.

How did you ensure that your design was responsive and accessible to all users?

I used Flexbox to create a responsive navigation bar and used a Grid to create a multi-column layout for the main content area that collapses to a single column on mobile devices.

I added media Query at 600px and 1024px breakpoints to check whether the web page is responding to different screen sizes and added accessibility features to make them usable for everyone.

What tools or resources did you find most helpful during this project?

I used "WebAIM Contrast Checker" to check color contrast. It helped to identify which combination of colors is good for both background and foreground colors to improve readability on the screen.

Course materials, MDN Web Docs and Google helped me to create this project.
